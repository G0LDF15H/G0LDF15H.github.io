      <description>Recently I completed Tier 1 of Target&amp;rsquo;s Cyber Defense Challenge offered to members of the WiCys (Women in Cybersecurity) organization. It was a CTF comprised of four categories: cryptography/steganography, reverse engineering, USB forensics, and cyber threat intelligence. In this first part, I will go over the challenges in the cryptography / steganography section.

In my opinion, this was the most technical challenge as knowledge of basic assembly (x86) and the C programming language was required.</description>
