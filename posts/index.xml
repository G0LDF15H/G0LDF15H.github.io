Starts with a &amp;ldquo;shebang&amp;rdquo; #! and path to shell you want script to use #!/bin/bash Executing the script Assign execution rights to user: chmod u+x &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;.sh chmod &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; modifies ownership of a file for the current user: u +x &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; execution rights Variables and data types Every variable is an array so can start using any variable as an array.</description>

      <description>Just a random sort of notes as I encounter things in C++
Command Line Arguments https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-c-cpp/
Command line arguments: values given after the name of the program in the command-line shell of OS. Handled by main
argc (argument count): number of command-line arguments
Non- negative argv (argument vector): array of character pointers listing all the arguments
argv[0] name of the program -argv[1] points to the first command line argument Compiling with g++ https://natekohl.</description>

      <description>Incomplete; Probably won&amp;rsquo;t finish
Checkpoint 1: &amp;ldquo;Air-gapped&amp;rdquo; Points 10
The FBI infiltrated SHINY SCORPION&amp;rsquo;s command &amp;amp; control network!
They&amp;rsquo;ve passed along the victim database related to the campaign that targeted Keep it Simple Security (KiSSec). They&amp;rsquo;ve also included a Python script that can deobfuscate and parse the ransomware config.
FBI intelligence indicates that it should be possible to undo the ransomware&amp;rsquo;s encryption using the information stored in these files!
Before we start any decryption, though, they suggest finding our unique victim ID.</description>

      <description>Recently I completed Tier 1 of Target&amp;rsquo;s Cyber Defense Challenge offered to members of the WiCys (Women in Cybersecurity) organization. It was a CTF comprised of four categories: cryptography/steganography, reverse engineering, USB forensics, and cyber threat intelligence. In this first part, I will go over the challenges in the cryptography / steganography section.

In this second part, I will go over the challenges in the reverse engineering section. In my opinion, this was the most technical challenge as knowledge of basic assembly (x86) and the C programming language was required.</description>
